## Motivation
Through a variety of courses at university I had learnt the individual components of
creating a web app, i.e. JS/NodeJS/Express, React, PostgreSQL. However, I was not sure how 
to create a program from scratch using all of them.

Hence, I chose to create this simple todo app to better understand how the different parts of a
full-stack project work together. 

This project was guided by freeCodeCamp.org's [PERN Stack Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8&t=4787s)

## Usage
1. Start the server:
